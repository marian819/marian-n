        <h3>Savings Account</h3>
        <p>
          A savings account is a bank account at a retail bank. Common features
          include a limited number of withdrawals, a lack of cheque and linked
          debit card facilities, limited transfer options and the inability to
          be overdrawn. Traditionally, transactions on savings accounts were
          widely recorded in a passbook, and were sometimes called passbook
          savings accounts, and bank statements were not provided; however,
          currently such transactions are commonly recorded electronically and
          accessible online.
